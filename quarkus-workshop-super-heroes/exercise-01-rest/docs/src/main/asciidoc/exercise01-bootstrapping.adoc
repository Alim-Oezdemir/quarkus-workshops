=== Troubleshooting

You might come accross the following error while developping:

[source,shell]
----
WARN  [io.qu.ne.ru.NettyRecorder] (Thread-48) Localhost lookup took more than one second, you need to add a /etc/hosts entry to improve Quarkus startup time. See https://thoeni.io/post/macos-sierra-java/ for details.
----

If this is the case, it's just a matter to add the node name of your machine to the /etc/hosts. For that, first get the name of your node with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ uname -n
my-node.local
----

Then `sudo vi /etc/hosts` so you have the rights to edit the file and add the following entry

[source,shell]
----
127.0.0.1 localhost my-node.local
----
