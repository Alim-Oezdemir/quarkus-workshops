= Open API

By default, a Quarkus application exposes its API description through an OpenAPI specification.
Quarkus also lets you test it via a user-friendly UI named Swagger UI.

== Directory Structure

In this module we will add extra class (`HeroApplication`) to the Hero API project.
You will end-up with the following directory structure:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
super-heroes
+  rest-hero
++  src
+++  main
++++  java
+++++  io
++++++  quarkus
+++++++  workshop
++++++++  superheroes
+++++++++  hero
++++++++++  Hero.java
++++++++++  HeroApplication.java
++++++++++  HeroResource.java
++++++++++  HeroService.java
++  pom.xml
}
}

== Installing the OpenAPI Dependency

Quarkus proposes a `smallrye-openapi` extension compliant with the Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI specification in order to generate your API OpenAPI v3 specification.footnote:[MicroProfile OpenAPI https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api]
To install the OpenAPI dependency, just run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="openapi"
----

This will add the following dependency in the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/pom.xml[tags=adocDependencyOpenAPI]
----

== Open API

Now, we are ready to restart our application (stop it first if you didn't):

[source,shell]
----
$ ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
----

Once your application is started, you can make a request to the default `http://localhost:8083/openapi` endpoint:

[source,yaml]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/openapi-origin.yaml[]
----

[NOTE]
====
Use cURL to retrieve the document:
`curl http://localhost:8083/openapi`
====

This contract lacks of documentation.
The Eclipse Microprofile OpenAPI allows you to customize the methods of your REST endpoint as well as the application.

=== Customizing Methods

The Microprofile OpenAPI has a set of annotations to customize each REST endpoint method so the OpenAPI contract is richer and clearer for consumers:

* `@Operation`: Describes a single API operation on a path.
* `@APIResponse`: Corresponds to the OpenAPI Response model object which describes a single response from an API Operation
* `@Parameter`: The name of the parameter.
* `@RequestBody`: A brief description of the request body.

This is what the `HeroResource` endpoint looks like once annotated

----

=== Customizing the Application

The previous annotations allow you to customize the contract for a given REST Endpoint.
But it's also important to customize the entire application.
The Microprofile OpenAPI also has a set of annotation to do so.
The difference is that these annotations cannot be used on the Endpoint itself, but instead on another Java class configuring the entire application.
For this we have the `src/main/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/HeroApplication` class:

[source]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/src/main/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/HeroApplication.java[tags=adocApplication]
----

=== Customized Contract

If you go back to the `http://localhost:8083/openapi` endpoint you will see the following OpenAPI contract:

[source,yaml]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/openapi.yaml[]
----

== Swagger UI

When building APIs, developers want to test them quickly.
Swagger UI is a great tool permitting to visualize and interact with your APIs.footnote:[Swagger UI https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui]
The UI is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification.
The Quarkus `smallrye-openapi` extension comes with a swagger-ui extension embedding a properly configured Swagger UI page.
By default, Swagger UI is accessible at `/swagger-ui`.
So, once your application is started, you can go to `http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui` and play with your API.

You can visualize your API's operations and schemas.

== OpenAPI Tests in HeroResourceTest

Let's add a few extra test methods that would make sure OpenAPI and Swagger UI are packaged in the application:

[source,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/src/test/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/HeroResourceTest.java[tags=adocOpenAPI]
----

Execute the test using `./mvnw test`.
The test should pass.
