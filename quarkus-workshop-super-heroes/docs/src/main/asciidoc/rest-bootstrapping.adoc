== Bootstrapping the Hero REST Endpoint

The easiest way to create a new Quarkus project is to use Maven archetype.
Let's say you have a `quarkus-workshop` root directory where you have all your code, create a `api-hero` sub-directory, open a terminal and run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/bootstrap.sh[tag=adocSnippet]
----

== Directory Structure

Once you bootstrap the project, you get the following directory structure with a few Java classes and other artifacts :

[source,text]
----
.
└── hero-api
   ├── mvnw
   ├── mvnw.cmd
   ├── pom.xml
   └── src
       ├── main
       │   ├── docker
       │   │   ├── Dockerfile.jvm
       │   │   └── Dockerfile.native
       │   ├── java
       │   │   └── io
       │   │       └── quarkus

       │   │               └── superheroes

       │   │                       └── HeroResource.java
       │   └── resources
       │       ├── META-INF

               └── io
                   └── quarkus
                       └── workshop
                           └── superheroes
                               └── hero
                                   ├── HeroResourceTest.java
                                   └── NativeHeroResourceIT.java
----

The Maven archetype generates the following `api-hero` sub-directory:

* the Maven structure with a `pom.xml`
* an `io.quarkus.workshop.superheroes.hero.HeroResource` resource exposed on `/api/heroes`
* an associated unit test
* the landing page `index.html` that is accessible on http://localhost:8080 after starting the application
* example Dockerfile files for both native and jvm modes in `src/main/docker`
* the `application.properties` configuration file

Once generated, look at the `pom.xml`.
You will find the import of the Quarkus BOM, allowing you to omit the version on the different Quarkus dependencies.
In addition, you can see the `quarkus-maven-plugin` responsible of the packaging of the application and also providing the development mode.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/pom.xml[tags=adocProperties;!adocPropertiesTestcontainers]
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/pom.xml[tags=adocDependencyManagement;!adocDependencyTestBom]
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/pom.xml[tags=adocBuild]
----

If we focus on the dependencies section, you can see the extension allowing the development of REST applications:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/pom.xml[tags=adocDependencyResteasy]
----

== The JAX-RS resource

During the project creation, the `src/main/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/HeroResource.java` file has been created with the following content:

[source]
----
@Path("/api/heroes")
public class HeroResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

It's a very simple REST endpoint, returning "hello" to requests on "/hello".

== Running the application

Now we are ready to run our application.
Use: `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev`:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
[INFO] -------------< io.quarkus.workshop.super-heroes:hero-api >--------------

[ERROR] Port 5005 in use, not starting in debug mode

2019-10-04 10:08:12,295 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [cdi, resteasy]
----

Then check that the endpoint returns `hello` as expected:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/heroes
hello
----

== Development Mode

`quarkus:dev` runs Quarkus in development mode.
This enables hot deployment with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and invoke a REST endpoint (i.e. cUrl command or refresh your browser), these changes will automatically take effect.
This works too for resource files like the configuration property file.
Refreshing the browser triggers a scan of the workspace, and if any changes are detected, the Java files are recompiled and the application is redeployed;
your request is then serviced by the redeployed application.
If there are any issues with compilation or deployment an error page will let you know.

This will also listen for a debugger on port 5005.
If you want to wait for the debugger to attach before running you can pass `-Ddebug` on the command line.
If you don't want the debugger at all you can use `-Ddebug=false`.

To check that the hot reload is working, update the method `HeroResource.hello()` by returning the String "hello hero".
Now, execute the cUrl command again, the output has changed without you to having to stop and restart Quarkus:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/heroes
hello hero
----

== Testing

All right, so far so good, but wouldn’t it be better with a few tests, just in case.

In the generated `pom.xml` file, you can see 2 test dependencies:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/pom.xml[tags=adocDependencyTest]
----

Quarkus supports Junit 4 and Junit 5 tests.
In the generated project, we use Junit 5.
Because of this, the version of the Surefire Maven Plugin must be set, as the default version does not support Junit 5:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/pom.xml[tags=adocProperties;!adocPropertiesTestcontainers]
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/pom.xml[tags=adocBuildSurefire]
----

We also set the `java.util.logging` system property to make sure tests will use the correct logmanager.

The generated project contains a simple test in `src/test/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/HeroResourceTest.java`.

[source]
----
@QuarkusTest
public class HeroResourceTest {

    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        given()
          .when().get("/api/heroes")
          .then()
             .statusCode(200)
             .body(is("hello"));
    }
}
----

By using the `QuarkusTest` runner, the `HeroResourceTest` class instructs JUnit to start the application before the tests.
Then, the `testHelloEndpoint` method checks the HTTP response status code and content.
Notice that these tests use RestAssured, but feel free to use your favorite library.footnote:[RestAssured http://rest-assured.io]

Execute it with `./mvnw test` or from your IDE.

== Packaging and run the application

The application is packaged using `./mvnw package`.
It produces 2 jar files in `/target`:

* `hero-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` : containing just the classes and resources of the projects, it’s the regular artifact produced by the Maven build;
* `hero-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` : being an executable jar. Be aware that it’s not an über-jar as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

You can run the application using: `java -jar hero-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

[NOTE]
====
Before running the application, don’t forget to stop the hot reload mode (hit CTRL+C), or you will have a port conflict.
====

== Troubleshooting

You might come across the following error while developing:

[source,shell]
----
WARN  [io.qu.ne.ru.NettyRecorder] (Thread-48) Localhost lookup took more than one second, you need to add a /etc/hosts entry to improve Quarkus startup time. See https://thoeni.io/post/macos-sierra-java/ for details.
----

If this is the case, it's just a matter to add the node name of your machine to the /etc/hosts. For that, first get the name of your node with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ uname -n
my-node.local
----

Then `sudo vi /etc/hosts` so you have the rights to edit the file and add the following entry

[source,shell]
----
127.0.0.1 localhost my-node.local
----
