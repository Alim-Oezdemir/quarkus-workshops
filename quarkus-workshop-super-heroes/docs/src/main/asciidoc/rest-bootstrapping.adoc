== Bootstrapping the Hero REST Endpoint

The easiest way to create a new Quarkus project is to use Maven archetype.
Let's say you have a `quarkus-workshop` root directory where you have all your code, create a `hero-api` sub-directory, open a terminal and run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus-workshop/hero-api $ mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:0.23.1:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=io.quarkus.workshop.super-heroes \
    -DprojectArtifactId=hero-api \
    -DclassName="io.quarkus.workshop.superheroes.hero.HeroResource" \
    -Dpath="/api/heroes"

== Development

=== Troubleshooting

You might come accross the following error while developping:

[source,shell]
----
WARN  [io.qu.ne.ru.NettyRecorder] (Thread-48) Localhost lookup took more than one second, you need to add a /etc/hosts entry to improve Quarkus startup time. See https://thoeni.io/post/macos-sierra-java/ for details.
----

If this is the case, it's just a matter to add the node name of your machine to the /etc/hosts. For that, first get the name of your node with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ uname -n
my-node.local
----

Then `sudo vi /etc/hosts` so you have the rights to edit the file and add the following entry

[source,shell]
----
127.0.0.1 localhost my-node.local
----
