In the following sections, you will develop a REST API allowing CRUD operations on Super Heroes.

This microservice is let's say a _classical_ microservice.
It uses HTTP to expose a REST API and internally store data into a database.
This service will be used by the _fight_ microservice.

In this chapter, you learn:
* how to create a new Quarkus application
* how to implement REST API using Jax-RS
* how to compose your application using CDI beans
* how to access your database using Hibernate with Panache
* how to use transactions
* how to enable openAPI and swagger

But first, let's describe our service.
The Super Heroes microservice stores super-heroes, with their names, powers, and so on.
The REST API allows adding, removing, listing, and picking a random hero from the stored set.
