= User Interface

Now that we have the three main microservices, time to have a decent user interface to start fighting.
The purpose of this workshop is not to develop a web interface and learn _yet another web framework_.
This time you will just download an Angular application, install it, and run it on another Quarkus instance.

== Downloading the Web Application

Download the zip file {github-raw}/super-heroes/ui-super-heroes/ui-super-heroes.zip and unzip the entire code into your `ui-super-heroes` directory.
Being an Angular application, you will find a `package.json` file which defines all the needed dependencies.
Notice that there is a `pom.xml` file.
This is just a convenient way to install NodeJS and NPM so we can build the Angular application with Maven.
The `pom.xml` also allows us to package the Angular application into Quarkus.

== Looking at Some Code

You don't need to be an Angular expert, but there are some pieces of code that are worth looking at.
If you look under the `src/app/shared` directory, you will find an `api` and a `model` sub-directory.
Let's look at `fight.ts`.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/ui-super-heroes/src/app/shared/model/fight.ts[tag=adocModel]
----

As you can see, it matches our `Fight` Java class.
Same for `fighters.ts`, `hero.ts` or `villain.ts`.
Under `api` there is the `fight.service.ts` that defines all the methods to access to our Fight REST API through HTTP.

[source,typescript,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/ui-super-heroes/src/app/shared/api/fight.service.ts[tag=adocService]
----

Well, guess what?
We didn't have to type this code either.
It was generated thanks to a tool called `swagger-codegen`.footnote:[Swagger Codegen https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen]
Because our Fight REST API exposes an OpenAPI contract, `swagger-codegen` just swallows it, and generates the TypeScript code to access it.
It's just a matter of running:

[source,shell]
----
$ swagger-codegen generate -i http://localhost:8082/openapi -l typescript-angular -o src/app/shared
----

Here, you see another advantage of exposing an OpenAPI contract:
it documents the API which can be read by a human, or processed by tools.

== Installing the Web Application on Quarkus

Thanks to the `frontend-maven-plugin` plugin declared on the `pom.xml`, we can use a good old Maven command to install and build this Angular application.
Execute `./mvnw install` and Maven will download and install Node JS and NPM and build the application.
You should now have a `node_modules` directory with all the Angular dependencies.

To install the Angular application into a Quarkus instance, we just build the app and copy the bundles under the `resources/META-INF/resources` directory.
Look at the `package.sh`, that's exactly what it does.

[source,shell]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/ui-super-heroes/package.sh[tag=adocShell]
----

Execute the `package.sh` script.
You will see all the Javascript files under `resources/META-INF/resources` directory.
We are now ready to go.

== Running the Web Application

As usual, use `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev` to start the web application.
Once the application is started, go to http://localhost:8080 (8080 is the default Quarkus port as we didn't change it in the `application.properties` this time).
It should display the main web page.
Start playing!

Oups, not working yet!
Let's move on to the next section then and make the application work.
