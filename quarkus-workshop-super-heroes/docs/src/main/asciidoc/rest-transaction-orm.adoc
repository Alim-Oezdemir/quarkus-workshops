== Using injection

Dependency injection in Quarkus is based on ArC which is a CDI-based dependency injection solution tailored for Quarkus' architecture.footnote:[ArC https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/tree/master/independent-projects/arc]
You can learn more about it in the Contexts and Dependency Injection guide.footnote:[Quarkus - Contexts and Dependency Injection https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference.html]

ArC comes as a dependency of `quarkus-resteasy` so you already have it handy.

Let's modify the application so that the `HeroResource` injects a reference to `HeroService`:

[source]
----
@Path("/api/heroes")
public class HeroResource {

    @Inject
    HeroService service;
    ...
}
----
