= Timeout

Sometimes invoking a REST API can take long.
In fat, the more microservices invoke other microservices, the more network latency you can have.
And what happens when a HTTP request takes long?
Well, if hangs.
On your browser you can the request pending if you turn on the dev tools and look at what's the network is doing.

== Adding Timeouts

Getting random fighters can take longer than expected.
To simulate a long running process, update the `FightResource` with the following code:

[source]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-fight/src/main/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/fight/FightResource.java[tags=adocFaultTolerance;!adocMetrics]
----

Let's say we've added some new functionality in the `veryLongProcess` method.
When the process is really too long and the system is overloaded, we would rather time out.

[NOTE]
====
Here we throw the `InterruptedException` in the method signature.
But what you would have to do in real life is to catch it, and propose a fallback algorithm when the process timesout.
====

Note that the timeout was configured to 250 ms, and a `Thread.sleep` was introduced and can be configured in the `application.properties`.
If we set the property to a higher value than the timeout, let's say 10.000, then the request should be interrupted.

== Running the Application

Now that you have set the number of waiting milliseconds to 10.000, run the application and start fighting again.
You should see the following:
