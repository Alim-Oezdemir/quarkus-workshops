= Configuration Profile

Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles.
These allow you to have multiple configuration in the same file and select between them via a profile name.

By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. The default profiles are:

* `dev` - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)
* `test` - Activated when running tests
* `prod` - The default profile when not running in development or test mode

Let's change the `HeroApplicationLifeCycle` so it displays the current profile.
For that, just add a log invoking the `ProfileManager.getActiveProfile()` method:
