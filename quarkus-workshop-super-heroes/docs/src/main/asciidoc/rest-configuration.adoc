= Configuration

Hardcoded values in our code are a no go (even if we all did it at some point ;-)).
In this guide, we learn how to configure our Hero API.

== Injecting configuration value

Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] to inject the configuration in the application.
The injection uses the `@ConfigProperty` annotation.


[NOTE]
====
When injecting a configured value, you can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.
The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`, a behavior which differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].
